SMSspliceJDB represents a comprehensive database consisting repository of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations with potential implications for splicing in cancer patients. Within this repository, a user-friendly interface has been created to enhance accessibility for researchers. Upon entering a specific gene of interest, users gain access to a wealth of information, including both experimentally validated mutations and and variants positioned within acceptor and donor splice junctions.

SMSspliceJDB also offers protein plots that position splice site variants within the context of corresponding protein domains. These plots provide an easy way to see where the mutations are located and understand how they might affect splicing. The information about protein length and domain details in these plots helps researchers interpret mutations more precisely, giving insights into their potential impact on the structure and function of proteins.

This database allows users to explore and download the entire database for a given input gene. This downloadable dataset consists of key entries such as mutation information, amino acid changes, SIFT scores, Phastcons scores, and splicing prediction scores. Such comprehensive access to information empowers researchers to conduct in-depth analyses and extract valuable insights for their investigations.
