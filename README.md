# SMSspliceJDB
SMSspliceJDB is a comprehensive and user-friendly database designed to support researchers studying synonymous and non-synonymous mutations with potential splicing implications in cancer patients.

SMSspliceJDB provides a centralized repository of mutations located within acceptor and donor splice junctions, helping researchers understand how these variants may impact RNA splicing and protein function. It includes:

- Experimentally validated mutations
- Predicted splice site variants
- Contextual protein plots
- Downloadable data for in-depth analysis

## Key Features
- Gene-Specific Search Interface
- Splice Junction Annotations
- Lollipop and Protein Domain Plots
- Downloadable Dataset

## Research Applications
SMSspliceJDB is especially valuable for researchers investigating the role of splicing alterations in cancer. By consolidating and visualizing critical splice site data, the platform helps users:
- Identify promising mutation candidates for experimental follow-up
- Understand the potential effects of splicing alterations on protein function
- Guide hypothesis generation for functional genomics and cancer biology studies

## Visualizations
Lollipop plots display mutation locations and protein structures within user-defined genes, focusing on splice site junctions in cancer patients and experimentally validated splice site mutations.
